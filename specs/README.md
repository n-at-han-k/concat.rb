  HOW TO MAINTAIN THIS FILE

  This is the index of all design specifications for concat.rb.
  Each row links a spec document to its implementation code and a short purpose summary.

  When adding a new spec:
  1. Create the markdown file in this directory (specs/)
  2. Add a row to the appropriate table section below
  3. Link the spec file, the code path it describes, and a brief purpose

  Table format:
    | [spec-name.md](./spec-name.md) | [path/to/code](../path/to/code) | Short description |

  Use "—" in the Code column if the spec has no implementation yet.
  Group specs under heading sections by domain area.
